CHAPTER 3: Cluster is your enemy

Cognitive load: mental effort required to learn new information. Avoid extraneous cognitive load.
Clutter: visual elements that take up space but don't increase understanding.
Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception: proximity, similarity, enclosure, closure, continuity and connection.
Visual clutters: (1) lack of visual order: alignment (avoid diagonal components), white space (use strategically) 
                 (2) non-strategic use of contrast
Decluttering: (1) remove chart border (2) remove gridlines (3) remove data markers 
              (4) clean up axis labels (5) label data directly (6) leverage consistent color
       

CHAPTER 4: Focus your audience's attention

Memory: Iconic memory, short-term memory, long-term memory.
Preattentive attributes: iconic memory is tuned to them. Enable our audience to see what we want them to see before they realise.
Preattentive attributes create visual hierarchy in our communications.
For graph: size, color (use sparingly, consistently, mind colorblind, be thoughtful of tone), position on page.


CHAPTER 5: Think like a designer

Affordances: aspects inherent to the design that make it obvious how to use.
- Hightlight: only highlight no more than 10%
- Eliminate distractions: clutter and context (what needs to be present for your audience in order for what you want to communicate to make sense)
- Create a clear visual hierarchy of information
Accessibility: design should be usable by people of diverse abilities.
- Don't overcomplicate: legible, clean, straightforward, remove unnecessary complexity
- Text is your friend
Aesthetics: more aesthetic designs are easier to use and more readily accepted and used over time.
- Color
- Alignment
- White space
Acceptance: effective design must be accepted by its intended audience.
- Articulate the benefits
- Show side-by-side
- Provide multiple options and seek input
- Get a vocal member of your audience on board
